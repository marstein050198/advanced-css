            <p>I have never been more excited for a trip in my entire life, when my friends and I decided to adventure to Iceland.  I went to Iceland for a true adventure. We drove out about 2 hours from Reykjavik on a bus with a really cool tour guide. After driving two hours, my friends and I piled into a Jeep, where we off-roaded to a little hut by one of Iceland’s most famous glaciers. It was bitterly freezing cold. We then suited up in snow suits that kept as warm from head-to-toe, geared up with helmets, goggles, and gloves, and picked out our ride. By ride, I mean snowmobile. My sister and I shared one, and I drove us fast, following the tour guide in pure awe. The tour guide stopped us, and pointed to a medium sized hole in the midst of an all white scenery. There was no visibility, and all we could see was the hole. We all climbed into it, and were brought into a different world; an underground world of icy sculptures. Being inside a cave seemed unrealistic, and exploring it was one of my favorite memories.

            <p>When googling things to do in Iceland, my number one priority was to hit the black sand beaches. They looked dark and mysterious, something I never associated with a beach scene before. Being from south Florida and a big beach enthusiast, I love experiencing beaches from different parts of the world. Iceland was freezing cold, so I knew this beach experience would be different from what I was used to. When we got to the beach, I was mesmerized by the thick black sand. Our tour guide explained it was from volcanic ash, and asked us to pick up a scoop to really see and feel it. It felt soft and thick, it was unique and far different than the golden sand I’ve sunk my toes in. We were advised to stay twenty feet away from the water. The waves were terrifying, and looked like they could kill you with a singular touch. Our tour guide confirmed their danger, yet beautiful flow. We climbed up the rocks surrounding the beach away from the water and were given the most beautiful views.

            <p>Iceland was truly one of the most beautiful and exotic places I’ve been to. When my friends invited me on the trip, I really didn't know what to expect; it sounded awesome and I left the planning up to them, so I really didn’t know what types of things we’d be doing or what there was even to see in Iceland. The trip was unreal from the second we got there. We stayed in an airbnb right on the Greenland sea, our views were amazing right from the start. We then went straight to the blue lagoon, which is essentially a natural hot spring. Unbenounced to me, my friends had all bought tickets to enter the lagoon. I thought they bought mine, and I missed the memo that we all were purchasing them individually on our own before we got there. I have the best friends in the world, and they convinced the icelandic woman to let me in with them to experience this once and a lifetime beauty. Drinking and hanging out with friends with impeccable views, submerged in the bluest warmest water I’ve ever seen was something I’ll never forget.

            <p>I’d have to say the golden circle tour was my favorite part of Iceland. We were driven out about an hour away from Reykjavik and taken to the geysers. We did a bunch of different stops at many different locations. It was the most freezing day by far. My friends and I stayed bundled up together as we walked from each location. The places we went to were beautiful national parks, and we were able to watch the geysers erupt if we stood there long enough. The steaming hot water flew like rivets through the air, and it was so entertaining to watch. My friends and I challenged each other on who could take the coolest video, for us to remember seeing this forever. We got some really good ones. On this tour we also visited the Eurasian/ North American tectonic plate rift, where we jumped from rock to rock...also border to border! It was cool to experience the geography we study in our textbooks, and be able to see it in real time.

            <p>I’m not quite the adventurous type, so I’m not going to lie, I was a little nervous about going to Iceland after seeing what my friends had planned and were so excited about. Before committing to this trip, my boyfriend and I were thinking about going to Paris, but both agreed that Iceland with our friends would be a once and a lifetime experience, and that we should definitely take part in it while we can. I loved the blue lagoon, seeing the geysers were cool, snowmobiling was a bit scary but fun, but most of all I appreciated Iceland’s fresh cuisine. Being right off the Greenland sea, my friends and I ordered fish at almost every meal. It was the best fish I’ve ever tasted. I will say, Iceland gets creative and a bit adventurous when it comes to designing menu items; things like whale and puffin featured in almost every restaurant. My favorites were the salmon burgers and the Icelandic hotdogs. I love ordering food native to the city I’m in, it really enriches the experience and makes me feel at home as a tourist!
